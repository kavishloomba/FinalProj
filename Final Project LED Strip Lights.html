            The image that is displayed is a picture of my working Arduino. The three wires going off to the left are for the microphone. 
            It is a 3.3 V microphone attached to the A0 input on the Arduino. The wires coming from the bottom of the image are the wires for the strip lights. 
            These Neopixel strip lights are 5 V and the digital signals are relayed through input 5 on the right. 
            Now onto the coding. To get any input from the microphone I used prewritten function code for that microphone.
            The input returned from the microphone is values 0-1024 representing the volume range detected by the microphone which is then mapped to be 0-255 representing the brightness range of the LEDs. 
            The returned value is then fed into the fillLEDs function because the getAudioLevel() function is given as the argument for the fillLEDs function. 
            The fillLEDs function then reads the given argument and whatever input it is given it uses that number to set the brightness of each light on the strip. 
            I coded this on the Arduino IDE and I had to download the FastLED.h library to get access to all the strip light functions. This is the link to my repository on github with my code:  https://github.com/kavishloomba/LEDProj
